# To-Do List (Trello Clone)

This is a simple To-Do list application inspired by Trello. It allows users to create lists, add tasks, and organize them on a board. The data is saved in `localStorage` so that it persists across page reloads. You can drag and drop tasks, and even remove tasks or lists as needed.

## Features

- Add new task lists (containers) to organize your tasks.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks within each list.
- Tasks can be dragged and dropped between lists.
- The entire board state is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, making it persistent across page reloads.
- Clear all tasks and lists with a confirmation prompt.

## Demo

You can try the application live by opening the HTML file in your browser or by hosting it on a web server.
